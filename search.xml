The methodology involved conducting a detailed task analysis of the interventions, and the application of the analytical hierarchy process. The authors were able to achieve high levels of consistency and reliability using this methodology to decompose and describe the interventions according to a complex conceptual framework comprising 3 dimensions: target domain, functional domain, and delivery system characteristics. Application of this methodology will enhance the ability to describe and measure interventions consistently, make comparisons across studies, isolate causal factors that achieve desired outcomes, and more generally elevate the science of psychosocial intervention research.</small></p><p><span style="font-size: smaller;">Czaja, S.

Associations of caregiver characteristics and outcomes were examined. For burden, active interventions were superior to control conditions (p&#x3D;. 022). Also, active interventions were superior to control conditions for women versus men and for caregivers with lower education versus those with higher education. For depressive symptoms, a statistically significant association of group assignment was found for Miami’s family therapy and computer technology intervention (p&#x3D;. 034). Also, active interventions were superior to control conditions for Hispanics, nonspouses, and caregivers with lower education. Results suggest interventions should be multicomponent and tailored.</small></p><p><span style="font-size: smaller;">Gitlin, L. N., Belle, S. H., Burgio, L. D., Czaja, S.

DESIGN: This study used data from Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer’s Caregiver Health (REACH II), a multisite randomized clinical trial of a behavioral intervention designed to improve the quality of life of caregivers in multiple domains. SETTING: REACH II. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred twelve Hispanic, 211 black, and 219 white family caregivers providing in‐home care to patients with dementia. MEASUREMENT: Based on conceptual and psychometric analyses, a 16‐item measure was developed that assesses six domains linked to caregiver risk and amenable to intervention: depression, burden, self‐care and health behaviors, social support, safety, and patient problem behaviors. The reliability and validity of the instrument was evaluated with 642 dementia caregiver dyads from the REACH II program. RESULTS: The measure was found to have acceptable internal consistency for a multidimensional scale and similar measurement properties for each of the racial and ethnic groups. Concurrent validity was also demonstrated for the measure. CONCLUSION: The REACH Risk Appraisal Measure developed in this study shows promise as an assessment tool that can be used in research, clinical, and community settings to guide, prioritize, and target needed areas of support for caregivers of patients with dementia.</small></p><p><span style="font-size: smaller;">Czaja, S.

Information technologies offer the potential of removing these barriers and facilitating the ability of caregivers to access needed support. This project evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of technology-based psychosocial intervention among minority family caregivers of dementia patients. Design: A feasibility and efficacy trial. Setting: Participants’ homes in the Greater Miami Community. Participants: One hundred ten (56 Hispanic American and 54 African American) caregivers of patients with dementia. Intervention: A technology-based multi-component psychosocial intervention was delivered in-home and via videophone technology over 5 months. The intervention was modeled after the REACH II intervention and targeted known areas of caregiver risk. Measurement: Standardized measures of depression, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/caregiver-burden">caregiver burden</a>, social support, and the caregivers’ perception of the caregiver’s experience were administered at baseline and 5 months post-randomization. Results: Overall, caregivers who received the intervention reported a decrease in burden, an increase in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/perceived-social-support">perceived social support</a> and positive perceptions of the caregiving experience. No effect was observed for depression. Most participants indicated that the intervention improved their caregiving skills and found the technology to be easy to use. Conclusions: A technology-based format was feasible for delivering a multi-component intervention to minority family dementia caregivers. The intervention improved caregiver outcomes for both Hispanic and African American caregivers. The results suggest that technology may help eliminate disparities in access to caregiver intervention programs.</small></p><p><span style="font-size: smaller;">Czaja, S.

Numerous intervention programs to alleviate CG distress have been developed and evaluated yet few have been implemented in community settings. This paper describes and presents outcomes from Community REACH, a community implementation of the evidence-based Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer’s Caregiver Health (REACH) II program. Research Design and Methods: Community REACH involved a partnership between REACH II investigators and United HomeCare Services (UHCS), a nonprofit home health organization that provides home health, personal care, companion, and respite services. The intervention program, an adapted version of an evidence-based program, was a 6-month multicomponent psychosocial intervention, which involved six individual face-to-face and six individual telephone sessions, and telephone support groups. One hundred and forty-six CGs who were primarily female (76%) and Latino, and providing care for an individual with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) were enrolled. Program effectiveness was assessed by examining changes in perceived social support, burden, and depression, and CG self-efficacy. Results: At 6 months, CGs reported significant decreases in depression, burden, being and bothered by the care recipient’s memory problems. There was also a significant decline in the number of CGs at risk for clinical depression. These improvements were maintained at 12 months and there was an increase in feelings of social support. Discussion and Implications: The findings indicate that evidence-based CG programs can be successfully implemented in community settings and benefit CGs of AD patients. A continued partnership between the program developers and community partners is key to implementation success..</small></p><p><span style="font-size: smaller;">Czaja, S. J., Lee, C.

Using the sociocultural stress and coping model as a guiding framework, the current study examined cross-cultural relationships among familism, social support, self-efficacy, and caregiving outcomes and examines how these relationships vary as a function of caregiver background characteristics. <strong>Methods:</strong> Baseline data were collected from 243 participants in the Caring for the Caregiver Network randomized controlled intervention trial. Participants completed measures assessing familism, social support, self-efficacy, positive aspects of caregiving, depression, and burden. <strong>Results:</strong> African American and Hispanic participants exhibited higher levels of familism compared to Whites. Compared to White participants, African Americans’ endorsement of familism predicted more positive caregiving appraisals. African Americans also reported greater levels of social support, which in turn predicted lower burden and depressive symptoms when compared with Whites. Exploratory analyses demonstrated significant associations between familism and self-efficacy. In the Hispanic subgroup, familism varied as a function of acculturation. <strong>Discussion:</strong> Results indicate that greater levels of familism and social support may exert a protective influence against adverse psychosocial caregiving outcomes. These findings can be used to inform intervention efforts targeting culturally congruent, family-centered approaches.</small></p><p><span style="font-size: smaller;">Czaja, S. J., Lee, C.

Examining varying definitions and thresholds of caregiver neglect may yield insights to inform intervention development. Our data were drawn from 244 dyads of racially&#x2F;ethnically diverse dementia caregivers (CG) and care-recipients (CR). Informed by prior research, we developed three definitional thresholds of caregiver neglect: (1) CR’s needs were unmet by CG (least restrictive); (2) CR’s needs were unmet by CG and there was no additional informal care (moderate restrictive); and (3) CR’s needs were unmet by CG and there was no additional informal or formal care (most restrictive). Variables selected for multivariate logistic regression models examining predictors of neglect were based on significance in bivariate analysis (p&lt; 0.10). One-week prevalence of caregiver neglect varied according to the three thresholds (43% to 11%). Sociodemographic characteristics of neglect differed across thresholds in bivariate analyses. The caregiver being male (OR&#x3D;4.1, 95%CI&#x3D;1.68-10.53) and being African American (OR&#x3D; 2.12, 95%CI&#x3D;1.01-4.54) was significantly associated with greater risk of neglect but only in the model predicting the least restrictive neglect. In models predicting moderate and most restrictive neglect, greater CG social support was associated with lower risk of neglect (OR&#x3D;0.95, 95%CI&#x3D;0.90-0.99; OR&#x3D;0.93, 95%CI&#x3D;0.89-0.98; respectively). Our findings indicate that caregiver neglect was common in our sample and that social support may play a key role in alleviating risk of neglect. Our analysis demonstrates important nuances in predictors of neglect by operationalizing neglect as a multifactorial phenomenon.</small></p><p><span style="font-size: smaller;">Chang, E.
